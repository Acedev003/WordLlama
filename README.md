## Quick Start

Install:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:dleemiller/wordllama.git
pip install .
```

Load the 64-dim model.
```python
from wordllama import load

# Load the WordLlama model
wl = load()

# Calculate similarity between two sentences
similarity_score = wl.similarity("i went to the car", "i went to the pawn shop")
print(similarity_score)  # Output: 0.4026190060777956

# Rank documents based on their similarity to a query
ranked_docs = wl.rank("i went to the car", ["i went to the park", "i went to the shop", "i went to the truck", "i went to the vehicle"], use_hamming=False)
print(ranked_docs)
# Output:
# [
#   ('i went to the vehicle', 0.8765271774778441),
#   ('i went to the truck', 0.5792372791755765),
#   ('i went to the shop', 0.45162150518177724),

## What is it?

WordLlama is a word embedding model that recycles components from large language models (LLMs) to create efficient and compact word representations (such as GloVe or Word2Vec).
WordLlama begins by extracting the token embedding codebook from a state-of-the-art LLM (e.g., LLama3 70B).

The key features of WordLlama include:

1. Dimension Reduction: We train a projection to reduce the embedding dimension, making it more manageable for various applications.
2. Low Resource Requirements: A simple token lookup with average pooling, enables this to operate fast on CPU.
3. Binarization: Models trained using the straight through estimator can be packed to small integer arrays for even faster hamming distance calculations.
4. Numpy-only inference: Keep it lightweight and simple.

To optimize for performance, WordLlama employs the Matryoshka training technique, allowing for flexible truncation of the embedding dimension.
For even greater efficiency, we implement straight-through estimators during training to produce binary embeddings.
This approach enables us to create ultra-compact representations, with the smallest model producing 64-bit embeddings that can leverage rapid hamming distance calculations.

The final weights are saved after weighting, projection and truncation of the entire tokenizer vocabulary. Thus, WordLlama becomes a single embedding matrix (nn.Embedding). The original
tokenizer is still used to preprocess the text into tokens, and the reduced size token embeddings are averaged. There is very little computation required, and the
resulting model sizes range from 16mb to 250mb for the 128k llama3 vocabulary.

## Embed Text

Hereâ€™s how you can load pre-trained embeddings and use them to embed text:

```python
from wordllama import load

# Load pre-trained embeddings
wl = load(dim=64)

# Embed text
embeddings = wl.embed(["the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", "and all that jazz"])
print(embeddings.shape)  # (2, 64)

# Binary embeddings are packed into uint32
# 64-dims => array of 2x uint32 
wl = load(dim=64, binary=True)
wl.embed("I went to the car", binarize=True, pack=True) # Output: array([[3029168104, 2427562626]], dtype=uint32)

# load large binary trained model
wl = load(dim=1024, binary=True)

# Use the use_hamming flag to binarize
similarity_score = wl.similarity("i went to the car", "i went to the pawn shop", use_hamming=True)
print(similarity_score)  # Output: 0.57421875

ranked_docs = wl.rank("i went to the car", ["van", "truck"], use_hamming=False)

# load a different model class
wl = load(config_name="mixtral")
```

## Training Notes

Smaller dimension standard models 64-256 benchmark very well compared to other word embedding models.
Binary embedding models showed more pronounced improvement at higher dimensions, and either 512 or 1024 is recommended for binary embedding,
though even 64-dimensions are useable for coarse applications.

Larger hidden dimensions in the original LLM produce better WordLlama models. The current MTEB results use the embedding codebook from
Llama3 70B, and anticipate further improvement when the 405B model is released. Deberta v3 Large has a similar vocab size, but only 1024
hidden dimension, and does not train as well as Llama3 8B (4096) or 70B (8192).

I am uncertain how much impact the vocabulary size has, and many tokens from the Llama3 tokenizer are different only by a space or punctuation.

## Roadmap

- Test distillation training from a larger embedding model
- Test other LLM token embeddings: small vocab like phi-3, xl vocab like gemma 2
- Test concatenation with Llama guard 2
- Retrain on llama3 405B (waiting on release...)
- Figure out hosting for final v1 weights
- Add some convenience methods for similarity
- Write a requirements minimized package with C python bindings for basic operations

## Features

- **Load and Embed**: Quickly load pre-trained embeddings and use them to embed texts.
- **Extract Embeddings**: Extract token embeddings from transformer-based models and save them for later use.
- **Matryoshka Training**: Truncate to size with Matryoshka embedding training
- **Binariz-able**: Even smaller and faster by training with straight through estimators for binarization.

Note: binary embeddings have a greater performance loss at smaller dimensions than dense embeddings.

Included is the 64-dim binary trained model, because it's small enough for GitHub. I'll update weights once the 405B parameter model is released.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dleemiller/wordllama.git
cd wordllama
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Extracting Token Embeddings

To extract token embeddings from a model, ensure you have agreed to the user agreement and logged in using the Hugging Face CLI (for llama3 models). You can then use the following snippet:

```python
from wordllama import Config
from wordllama.extract import extract_hf

# Extract embeddings for the specified configuration
extract_hf(Config.llama3_8B, "path/to/save/llama3_8B_embeddings.safetensors")
```
